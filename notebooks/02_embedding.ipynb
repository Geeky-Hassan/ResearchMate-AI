In this paper, a hierarchical classification framework has been\\nproposed for bridging the semantic gap effectively and achieving multi-category\\nimage classification. A well known pre-processing and post-processing method\\nwas used and applied to three problems; image segmentation, object\\nidentification and image classification. The method was applied to classify\\nsingle object images from Amazon and Google datasets. The classification was\\ntested for four different classifiers; BayesNetwork (BN), Random Forest (RF),\\nBagging and Vote. The estimated classification accuracies ranged from 20% to\\n99% (using 10-fold cross validation).

       "      <td>Vision foundation models have achieved remarkable progress across various\\nimage analysis tasks. In the image segmentation task, foundation models like\\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) enable generalizable zero-shot segmentation\\nthrough user-provided prompts. However, SAM primarily trained on natural\\nimages, lacks the domain-specific expertise of medical imaging. This limitation\\nposes challenges when applying SAM to medical image segmentation, including the\\nneed for extensive fine-tuning on specialized medical datasets and a dependency\\non manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from\\nmedical experts.\\n  This work introduces the Few-shot Adaptation of Training-frEe SAM (FATE-SAM),\\na novel method designed to adapt the advanced Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)\\nfor 3D medical image segmentation. FATE-SAM reassembles pre-trained modules of\\nSAM2 to enable few-shot adaptation, leveraging a small number of support\\nexamples to capture anatomical knowledge and perform prompt-free segmentation,\\nwithout requiring model fine-tuning. To handle the volumetric nature of medical\\nimages, we incorporate a Volumetric Consistency mechanism that enhances spatial\\ncoherence across 3D slices. We evaluate FATE-SAM on multiple medical imaging\\ndatasets and compare it with supervised learning methods, zero-shot SAM\\napproaches, and fine-tuned medical SAM methods. Results show that FATE-SAM\\ndelivers robust and accurate segmentation while eliminating the need for large\\nannotated datasets and expert intervention. FATE-SAM provides a practical,\\nefficient solution for medical image segmentation, making it more accessible\\nfor clinical applications.</td>\n",

Annotation and retrieval of the\\nimages pose classification problems, where each class is defined as the group\\nof database images labelled with a common semantic label. Various systems have\\nbeen proposed for content-based retrieval, as well as for image classification\\nand indexing. In this paper, a hierarchical classification framework has been\\nproposed for bridging the semantic gap effectively and achieving multi-category\\nimage classification. A well known pre-processing and post-processing method\\nwas used and applied to three problems; image segmentation, object\\nidentification and image classification. The method was applied to classify\\nsingle object images from Amazon and Google datasets. The classification was\\ntested for four different classifiers; BayesNetwork (BN), Random Forest (RF),\\nBagging and Vote. The estimated classification accuracies ranged from 20% to\\n99% (using 10-fold cross validation). The Bagging classifier presents the best\\nperformance, followed by the Random Forest classifier.   \n",
       "4  Vision foundation models have achieved remarkable progress across various\\nimage analysis tasks. In the image segmentation task, foundation models like\\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) enable generalizable zero-shot segmentation\\nthrough user-provided prompts. However, SAM primarily trained on natural\\nimages, lacks the domain-specific expertise of medical imaging. This limitation\\nposes challenges when applying SAM to medical image segmentation, including the\\nneed for extensive fine-tuning on specialized medical datasets and a dependency\\non manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from\\nmedical experts.\\n  This work introduces the Few-shot Adaptation of Training-frEe SAM (FATE-SAM),\\na novel method designed to adapt the advanced Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)\\nfor 3D medical image segmentation. FATE-SAM reassembles pre-trained modules of\\nSAM2 to enable few-shot adaptation, leveraging a small number of support\\nexamples to capture anatomical knowledge and perform prompt-free segmentation,\\nwithout requiring model fine-tuning. To handle the volumetric nature of medical\\nimages, we incorporate a Volumetric Consistency mechanism that enhances spatial\\ncoherence across 3D slices. We evaluate FATE-SAM on multiple medical imaging\\ndatasets and compare it with supervised learning methods, zero-shot SAM\\napproaches, and fine-tuned medical SAM methods. Results show that FATE-SAM\\ndelivers robust and accurate segmentation while eliminating the need for large\\nannotated datasets and expert intervention. FATE-SAM provides a practical,\\nefficient solution for medical image segmentation, making it more accessible\\nfor clinical applications.   \n",

    "Here are some reasons why I have chosen this model for my project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency: MiniLM models are smaller and faster than full-size BERT models, which can be a major advantage if you're working on a project with limited computational resources or if you need to process large amounts of data quickly.\n",
    "- Performance: Despite their smaller size, MiniLM models often perform at a comparable level to full-size BERT models on a variety of NLP tasks. This means that you can often use a MiniLM model without sacrificing much in the way of performance. In fact, the `Performance Sentence Embeddings` metric which is the average performance on encoding sentences over 14 diverse tasks from different domains is `68.06` for the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, which is very good to start with.\n",
    "- Ease of Use: If you're using a library like Hugging Face's Transformers, it can be relatively straightforward to load a pre-trained MiniLM model and fine-tune it for your specific task.\n",
    "- Lower Memory Requirements: Given its smaller size, MiniLM requires less memory for training and inference. This could be a crucial factor if you're working with limited hardware resources."
